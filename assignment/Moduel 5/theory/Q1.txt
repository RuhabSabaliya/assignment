SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

 
1. Data Management – SQL helps in storing, retrieving, and modifying structured data efficiently. 
 
2. Data Integrity – It enforces rules (constraints) to maintain data accuracy and consistency.
  
3. Security – SQL provides user access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized data access. 

4. Scalability – It supports large datasets and complex queries, making it suitable for enterprise applications. 
 
5. Standardization – SQL is widely used and supported by most database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. 
 
6. Data Analysis & Reporting – SQL queries allow businesses to extract meaningful insights from data.
